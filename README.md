# Music-Generation-Deep-Learning

## **Foreground**

A musical piece comprises of a characteristic sequence of musical notes (denoting different frequencies and pitches) played at different time instant. The think that needs to be noted here is that the notes that are being played cannot be played randomly. In layman's term the adjacent notes should have some sort of coherence within them so that the tune turns out to me melodius. 

This repo consists the code for generating music using deep learning, LSTMs to be specific. The main technologies used are:
* deep learning
* LSTMs
* RNN
