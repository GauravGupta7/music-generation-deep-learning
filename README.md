# Music-Generation-Deep-Learning

## **Foreground**

A musical piece comprises of a characteristic sequence of musical notes (denoting different frequencies and pitches) played at different time instant. The think that needs to be noted here is that the notes that are being played cannot be played randomly. In layman's term the adjacent notes should have some sort of coherence within them so that the tune turns out to be melodius. In this project we will try to develop some sort of mechanism that can predict the next note in the series using the previous notes. For this we will try to utilize the coherence between adjacent notes. 

This repo consists the code for generating music using deep learning, LSTMs to be specific. The main technologies used are:
* deep learning
* LSTMs
* RNN
